## Hi, I'm Phil.

Hi! My name is Phil Busch, and you’ve reached my small corner of the internet. Thanks for stopping by.

I’m a Software Engineer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. For the past seven years, I’ve had an awesome career writing software that has helped launch groundbreaking products and taken me all over the world. Currently, I’m working on cutting edge software for insurance brokers at Zywave. Previously, I’ve worked on custom distribution center software solutions at Dematic, and launched a product providing Just Intonation tuning to the digital piano for a startup called Intonation (now defunct).  If you’re interested in learning a little bit more about that, I recommend you check out my profile on LinkedIn.

In my free time, I love checking out new restaurants around town, walking my dog Wilfred, or heading out for a nice hike. Additionally, I love to travel, and I am always interested in discovering a new place.

If you have any questions, or want to reach me, try emailing me: phil at philbusch.com.
